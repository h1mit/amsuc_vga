2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell VGA_horizontal/blue_reg[3]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) image/column/blue_reg[2]/PRE, image/column/blue_reg[3]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell VGA_horizontal/red_reg[3]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) image/column/red_reg[3]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin image/counter_but_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch image/column/blue_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin image/column/blue_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch image/column/blue_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin image/column/blue_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch image/column/green_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin image/column/green_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch image/column/green_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin image/column/green_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch image/column/red_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin image/column/red_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch image/smile/blue_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin image/smile/blue_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch image/smile/red_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin image/smile/red_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
